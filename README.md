# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

This Project is thorugh application of machine learning with python programming. It focuses on Twitter Sentiment analysis using Machine Learning with scikit tools.

This project consist of building a system that can classify tweets as Sad or Happy.

I'm using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm here which I directly imported from SciKit Learn module in Python.
